Q1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

 Answer:- The database model is a one-to-many relationship.
In a one-to-many relationship, an instance of a field in one table can be related to multiple instances of another field in a different table. In the context of a particular database schema,
this means that a product may be classified as Product_Category, but Product_Category may have many products associated with it.
This relationship is managed using foreign keys. A foreign key is a column in one table that represents the primary key of another table. In the figure,
the "product_category_id" property in the "Product" table serves as a foreign key. 
It refers to the "id" key in the "Product_Category" table. This creates a link between the two tables, ensuring the data is consistent and complete.
For example, consider a "Product_Category" named "Electronics". This category will include many products in the Product category, such as laptops, headsets, and TVs.
Each product will have a unique identifier (such as "product_id") in the "Product" table, but they will all share the same "product_category_id" referencing the "Electronics" category.
One-to-many relationships are a fundamental concept in database design. They make data useful by grouping products into categories.
This simplifies data retrieval and management. For example, if you want to find all products in the "Electronics" category, you can query "Product" by the matching key "product_category_id".
One-to-many relationships are important to maintain data integrity. By sending the key content of the "Product_Category" table,
the foreign key in the "Product" table ensures that the product specified in the "Product" table is real. This helps avoid conflicts and errors.

Q2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
  
   Answer:-There are multiple approaches to guarantee that every item in the "Item" table has a one-to-many link between "Item" and "Item_Category" and is assigned to a legitimate group in the database system:

1. Database limitations

Foreign key restrictions:

Apply limitations using foreign keys to the "product_category_id" response in the "Product" field. The primary key ("id") of the "Product_Category" database is referred to by this parameter.
Products that are not present in the "Product_Category" table or that do not use "product_category_id" will not be allowed to be added to the database.
Verify the upper bound:

The "product_category_id" field in the "Product" database is where you would want to specify the limit.
This parameter can be used to restrict the list of acceptable items to which the returned "product_category_id" value can be appended
(e.g., only allow categories with a state of "activity").

2. Validation at the application level:
   
Before adding or changing data items, application code is validated.
Before adding the product to the 'Product_Category' table, these checks make sure that the specified 'product_category_id' value is present in 
the 'Product_Category' table.
Using this way allows you the freedom to handle faulty categories in your application using various techniques or error messages.

3. Facility data and administration:

Please make sure that every item is assigned to the category ID prior to placement when filling in the information (seeds).
Restricting users from adding or altering items to only choosing legitimate alternatives from drop-down lists or preset options
in the app is something to think about for continuous data management. This reduces the chance of human error. 4. Optional database triggers:
You can use data triggers to generate actionable data, provided your database system supports them.
The Product has triggers that can be set to activate either before or during updates.
In addition to preventing inaccurate or out-of-date information, the translator can confirm that the listing ID is present in the "Product_Category" table.
The management level, application architecture, and database system you use will all influence which approach you choose. Solutions to guarantee data integrity are frequently found by combining application-level procedures with data limitations.
